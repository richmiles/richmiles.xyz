    "overview": "TypeScript is JavaScript that grew up, moved out, and learned responsibility. It brings structure and sanity to frontend development, catching bugs at compile-time instead of letting them fester until runtime. My work with React, dashboards, and interactive visualizations leverages TypeScriptâ€™s robust type system, ensuring I spend less time debugging and more time building."
