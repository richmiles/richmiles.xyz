# Implementing Auth0 in iOS Applications

Authentication is a critical component of most modern applications. In this post, we'll explore how to integrate Auth0 into an iOS application while leveraging AI to enhance the development process.

## Initial Setup

First, we need to set up our Auth0 credentials:

```swift
let auth0 = Auth0.webAuth()
    .audience("your-api-identifier")
    .scope("openid profile email")
```

## The Authentication Flow

Here's a basic implementation of the login flow:

```swift
func login() {
    auth0
        .start { result in
            switch result {
            case .success(let credentials):
                print("Obtained credentials: \(credentials)")
                // Store tokens securely
            case .failure(let error):
                print("Failed with: \(error)")
            }
        }
}
```

## Secure Token Storage

It's crucial to store tokens securely. Here's how we can use the Keychain:

```swift
class TokenStorage {
    static func save(_ credentials: Credentials) {
        // Implementation using Keychain
    }
}
```

## Next Steps

In the next post, we'll explore:
1. Token refresh mechanisms
2. Logout implementation
3. Protected API calls
4. Error handling best practices

Stay tuned for more detailed implementations!
