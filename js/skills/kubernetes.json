    "overview": "Swift emerged as my savior from the chaos of cross-platform frameworks (.NET MAUI, Flutter, Expo), which always promised universality but as soon as something mildly complex came up, the wheels came off. Swift's simplicity and polished UI previews were a breath of fresh air after battling tangled build systems and quirky UI glitches. Sure, I'll grudgingly write apps twice (once for iOS and again for Android), but that's a small price to pay. However, Xcode? It can burn in a fire."
