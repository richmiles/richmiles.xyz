    "usage": "I design and implement context management systems, prompt engineering frameworks, and the integration layer that connects different LLMs to solve complex problems while ensuring efficient token usage.",

    "insight": "<p>When architecting a scalable LLM platform that integrates multiple models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, several critical design decisions were essential:</p><ol><li><strong>Unified API Layer:</strong> I created an abstraction layer that standardizes interaction with different models, allowing the application to seamlessly switch between providers based on strengths or availability.</li><li><strong>Context Management:</strong> Implemented a sophisticated context window manager that optimizes token usage and maintains conversation state across model boundaries.</li><li><strong>Prompt Engineering Framework:</strong> Built a template system that applies consistent prompt patterns while adapting to each model's specific strengths and limitations.</li><li><strong>Caching Strategy:</strong> Developed a multi-tiered caching system that reduces latency and costs by storing common responses while maintaining freshness.</li><li><strong>Rate Limiting & Fallback Mechanisms:</strong> Designed intelligent request routing that respects API limits and automatically falls back to alternative models during outages.</li></ol><p>The most challenging aspect was handling the different context window sizes and response characteristics between models. I solved this by implementing a dynamic chunking system that breaks large contexts into manageable pieces while preserving semantic meaning.</p><p>For cost optimization, I created a decision tree that routes requests to the most cost-effective model based on the complexity of the task, using simpler models for straightforward queries and premium models for complex reasoning.</p>"
