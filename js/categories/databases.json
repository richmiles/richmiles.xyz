    "content": "<p>My approach to database selection is pragmatic, focusing on:</p><ul><li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong> is my preferred choice for most applications due to its robust feature set, excellent performance, and strong support for JSON data. It's perfect for applications that need to scale.</li><li><strong>SQL Server</strong> comes into play for enterprise environments, especially when integrating with existing Microsoft technology stacks or when specific SQL Server features are required.</li><li><strong>SQLite</strong> is invaluable for embedded applications, local data storage, and development environments where a lightweight, zero-configuration database is ideal.</li><li><strong>SQLAlchemy</strong> provides a powerful abstraction layer that lets me efficiently work with multiple database engines through a consistent API.</li></ul><p>I believe in designing database schemas thoughtfully from the start, with proper normalization and performance considerations, rather than dealing with optimization problems later.</p>"
